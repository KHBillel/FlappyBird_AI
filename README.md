# Flappy Bird AI

This repository contains the code for training an AI agent to play Flappy Bird using a simple neural network. 

**Key Features:**

* **Reinforcement Learning:** The AI agent learns through trial and error, maximizing its reward by avoiding obstacles.
* **Neural Network:** A simple feedforward neural network is used to make decisions based on the game state.
* **Pygame:** The game environment is rendered using Pygame for visualization.
* **NumPy:** NumPy is used for efficient numerical computations.
